# Redis OpenSource Links

- [2018-RDR #Project#](https://github.com/xueqiu/rdr): RDR(redis data reveal) is a tool to parse redis rdbfile. Comparing to redis-rdb-tools, RDR is implemented by golang, much faster (5GB rdbfile takes about 2mins on my PC).

- [2018-Tidis #Project#](https://github.com/yongman/tidis): Tidis is a Distributed NoSQL database, providing a redis-protocal api(string,list,hash,set,sorted-set), written in Go.
